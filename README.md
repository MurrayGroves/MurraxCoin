 # MurraxCoin
A block-lattice based cryptocurrency made in Python as a hobby project. MurraxCoin is inspired by [Nano](https://nano.org/). It is feeless and uses block-lattice technology, where each account has its own blockchain, in order to be fast. In reality it probably isn't since it's made by me and in Python. Transactions are settled using Open Representative Voting (ORV), where each account votes on transactions. Voting power is decided by the account's balance. Since it is infeasible for all accounts to run a node, accounts can delegate their MurraxCoin to accounts which run nodes. No MurraxCoin is spent or locked away in this process.
